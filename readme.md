# [Popular Times](https://etotheipi1.github.io/popular-time/)

Collects Google's live visit data for shops around me and shows graphs of the averages by the day of the week.

Uses [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) for drawing the graph and [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) for dealing with time.
